# Boids in C++

Welcome to the Boids project! This repository contains a simulation of the Boids algorithm implemented in C++.

## Overview

The Boids algorithm, developed by Craig Reynolds in 1986, simulates the flocking behavior of birds by defining simple rules that each "boid" (bird) follows. These rules involve alignment, cohesion, and separation, resulting in emergent behavior such as flocking, swarming, and schooling.

This project provides a C++ implementation of the Boids algorithm, allowing you to explore and visualize the flocking behavior of simulated birds.

## Features

- Simulate the flocking behavior of birds using the Boids algorithm.
- Adjustable simulation parameters (number of boids, speed, visibility range, etc.).
- Real-time visualization of the flocking behavior.
- Customizable appearance and behavior of boids and the environment.

## Getting Started

To run the Boids simulation on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Greg301003/Boids.git

2. Build the project:

- Use your preferred C++ compiler and build system to compile the code.

- Make sure to install any necessary dependencies.

3. Run the simulation:

- Execute the compiled binary.

- Adjust the simulation parameters through command-line arguments or configuration files.

4. Observe the flocking behavior of the simulated birds!


## Usage

- Customize simulation parameters: 
 
  - Number of boids.
  - Speed and acceleration limits.
  - Visibility range.
  - Alignment, cohesion, and separation factors.
  - Environment boundaries.
